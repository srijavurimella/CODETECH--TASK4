## Overview of the Project  

### Project:   

### Objective  
This project fine-tunes the MobileNetV2 model, pre-trained on ImageNet, for CIFAR-10 classification by adding custom layers and training it on the dataset. It evaluates the model's performance and visualizes training and validation accuracy over epochs.  

### Key Activities  
**1.Preprocessing and Loading Data:** Normalize CIFAR-10 images and prepare them for training and testing.  
**2.Model Customization:** Fine-tune the MobileNetV2 base with added dense layers for CIFAR-10's 10-class classification.  
**3.Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the model on CIFAR-10 data, evaluate its performance, and visualize accuracy metrics.    


### Technologies Used  
**1.TensorFlow and Keras:** For building, training, and evaluating the deep learning model.  
**2.MobileNetV2:** A pre-trained deep learning model used as the base for transfer learning.  
**3.Matplotlib:** For visualizing training and validation accuracy.
